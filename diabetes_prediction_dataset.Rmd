## Feature Description

### `gender`: Biological Sex  
- **male**: 41%  
- **female**: 59%  
- **other**: 0%  

Gender may influence an individual's susceptibility to diabetes.

---

### `age`: Age  
Age is an important risk factor for diabetes — generally, older individuals have a higher likelihood of developing it.  
The age range in this dataset is **0 to 80 years**.

---

### `hypertension`: Presence of Hypertension  
- `0`: No hypertension  
- `1`: Has hypertension  

Hypertension is a known comorbidity and risk factor for diabetes.

---

### `heart_disease`: Presence of Heart Disease  
- `0`: No heart disease  
- `1`: Has heart disease  

Heart disease is strongly associated with increased diabetes risk.

---

### `smoking_history`: Smoking Behavior  
Smoking is a risk factor for diabetes and can worsen its complications. Categories include:

- `not current`: Previously smoked but not currently  
- `former`: Former smoker, now quit  
- `No Info`: No information available  
- `current`: Currently smoking  
- `never`: Never smoked  
- `ever`: Smoked at some point in the past

### `bmi`: Body Mass Index  
BMI is calculated from height and weight to assess body fat. Range: **10.16 to 71.55**

- BMI < 18.5: Underweight  
- 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9: Normal  
- 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9: Overweight  
- BMI ≥ 30: Obese

### `HbA1c_level`: Hemoglobin A1c  
HbA1c reflects average blood glucose levels over the past **2–3 months**.  
Levels above **6.5%** typically indicate diabetes risk.

---

### `blood_glucose_level`: Blood Glucose Level  
This refers to the concentration of glucose in the blood at a specific time.  
Higher glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes.

---

### `diabetes`: Target Variable (Diabetes Status)  
- `0`: Does not have diabetes  
- `1`: Has diabetes

Objective1:
Find out which features (such as age, bmi, gender, etc.) may have a significant statistical or pattern relationship with diabetes (values of 0 or 1)
