# CSP-571-Summer
This project focuses on building interpretable and reliable models for predicting diabetes using structured health data. We integrate multiple datasets — including the Diabetes Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, and the LARS dataset — to explore key risk factors and develop robust machine learning models.


## Overview of `diabetes_prediction_dataset.Rmd`

This file performs a comprehensive preprocessing and analysis of the **Diabetes Prediction Dataset**. The operations include:

- Data cleaning and deduplication  
- Exploration and visualization of feature relationships  
- Feature selection and transformation  
- Encoding of categorical variables (e.g., gender, smoking history)

In addition to preprocessing, this file applies and compares several machine learning models for predicting diabetes, including:

- **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**

These models are evaluated to identify key predictive factors and to assess model performance in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and interpretability.
