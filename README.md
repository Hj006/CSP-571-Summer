# CSP-571-Summer
This project focuses on building interpretable and reliable models for predicting diabetes using structured health data. We integrate multiple datasets — including the Diabetes Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, and the LARS dataset — to explore key risk factors and develop robust machine learning models.
